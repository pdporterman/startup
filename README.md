elevator pitch:
So I want to make a choose your own adventure game for my project! The goal is to make it like clue where the objective is to solve a murder mystery (or some other who did it style case TBD). Ideally I have it so that the culprit can be one of 6 people to allow for replay ability. upon multiple play through the player can learn about the culprits and will be able to tell who did it.


key feat:
*notes page that can remain unchanged between games and logins.
*a count of actions taken to beat the game
*time limit that may be based on actions taken

tech: 
players will login and create an account 
the notes for each player and their lowest actions taken score will be saved in the data base 
and a leader board at the start menu with the lowest actions taken of all the players a notification will be sent to all players as soon as someone enters the leader board or if the player was on the ledaer board they will be notified that they have lost thier place
