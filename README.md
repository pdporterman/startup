elevator pitch:
So I want to make a choose your own adventure game for my project! The goal is to make it like clue where the objective is to solve a murder mystery (or some other who did it style case TBD). Ideally I have it so that the culprit can be one of 6 people to allow for replay ability. upon multiple play through the player can learn about the culprits and will be able to tell who did it.
