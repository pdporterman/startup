elevator pitch:
So I want to make a choose your own adventure game for my project! The goal is to make it like clue where the objective is to solve a murder mystery (or some other who did it style case TBD). Ideally I have it so that the culprit can be one of 6 people to allow for replay ability. upon multiple play through the player can learn about the culprits and will be able to tell who did it.
key feat:
*notes page that can remain unchanged between games and logins.
*a count of actions taken to beat the game
*time limit that may be based on actions taken

tech: 
players will login and create an account 
the notes for each player and their lowest actions taken score will be saved in the data base 
and a leader board at the start menu with the lowest actions taken of all the players
